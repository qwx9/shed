## Themes

Yes.  This is now a system-wide change (because of the new libdraw),
which affects menu colors.  Unless a _/dev/theme_ is provided, nothing
changes.  _include/draw.h_ must be bound on top of
_/sys/include/draw.h_.

There is no real theme device maintained by rio(1).  Instead, use
namespaces to bind a directory containing a readable _theme_ file on
top of _/dev_ in your profile or wrapper scripts and call it a day:

	; mkdir -p $home/dev
	; cp $home/lib/theme/dicks $home/dev/theme
	; bind -a $home/dev /dev

There no longer is support for dynamic changes, but programs that use
a _/dev/theme_ will still behave as expected.  Other programs may
copypasta the theme snarfing code to use this mechanism as well.
Should you need this, look up [Sigrid's patches](http://ftrv.se/14),
on which everything is based.
